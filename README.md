# python_learning

## Description

- I would like to deepen my coding knowledge so I want to cement my understanding of how to code by learning Python. Since I am already somewhat proficient in Javascript, I want to translate those fundamental concepts to another popular learning language. This will help the concepts take root in my memory by learning them in another syntax.

This is how bilingual folks are able to learn better! :D
